# Nunjucks snippets for Atom
Snippets are an incredibly powerful way to quickly generate commonly needed code syntax from a shortcut.

The idea is that you can type something like `var` and then press the <kbd>Tab</kbd> key and it will expand into `{{ variable }}`.

You can see all available snippets in [the snippets readme](https://github.com/whatterz/atom-language-nunjucks/blob/master/snippets/README.md).

## Requirements
- [Atom](https://atom.io/) by [GitHub](https://github.com/)

## Installation
To add your own snippets, select the _Atom > Snippets..._ menu option if you're using macOS, or the _File > Snippets..._ menu option if you're using Windows, or the _Edit > Snippets..._ menu option if you are using Linux.

Snippets files are stored in a package's `snippets/` folder and also loaded from `~/.atom/snippets.cson`. They can be either `.json` or `.cson` file types.
